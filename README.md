# movie-database-app
This is my ALX capstone project. This project allows users to search for movies through API call by entering the movie name into the search bar and getting a response in return from the API.
The response shows the movie poster. When the movie poster is clicked, the details of the movie is displayed under the movie poster. 
I used concepts like state to handle state, use effect and control concepts like if statement.
I also implemented concepts like async and await for the API logic.
The key features of my app are the landing page which shows a header and a search bar component, the movie list components which renders on the page when the search button is clicked and the movie details component which shows additional details of the searched movie.
I had to use inline styling because I had difficulties trying to integrate tailwind css because of configuration issues from my nodejs configuration and I did nto want that to pull me back.
